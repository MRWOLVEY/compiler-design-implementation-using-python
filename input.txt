// _ for loop, pointer is at an adress, that adress is set to the loop length say 3:-
// first, the control pointer cP is shifted the location of the pointer to save the loop count
// _ then i specify how much the pointer should move before excuting the loop, and then i specify the loop logic
// i.e. _>1:!:>1:+acc , a program that calculates the sum of 3 consecutive adressses, instructions are separated by :

// ! alone is for increamenting the acc by the value of the current address (array[p])
// !@ is for assigning the value of the current address (array[p]) to the acc as it is
